# LAW-N Runtime Overview (LNRE)

LNRE is the execution engine for LAW-N programs. It exposes:

- A **bytecode-based VM**
- A **time-aware execution loop**
- An **N-SQL execution bridge**
- A **channel router** for logical flows
- **Device hooks** for external profiles

See `bytecode-spec.md` and `timing-model.md` for deeper details.
